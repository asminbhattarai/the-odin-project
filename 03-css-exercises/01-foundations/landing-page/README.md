# Project: Landing Page

## About
This is my second HTML project, where I created a landing page using flexbox for layout design. The project focuses on building a static page that mimics a provided design.

## Goal
The goal of this project was to replicate a landing page design provided in the specifications. The page is not yet responsive but designed to function on desktop screen sizes.
