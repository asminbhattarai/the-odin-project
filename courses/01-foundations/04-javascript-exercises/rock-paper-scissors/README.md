# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## About
This is an interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player competes against the computer, and the game is played through a graphical user interface (UI) in the browser. The user selects one of three weapons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and the computer randomly picks its move. The game updates the score after each round and continues until one player reaches 5 points.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a fun, interactive game where the user plays against the computer. Players can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the winner of each round is determined based on the game rules. The game keeps track of the scores, and after one player reaches 5 points, the winner is announced. Users can restart the game anytime.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: The game includes a simple, easy-to-use webpage interface where users can click on their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) represented by images (SVGs).
- **Instructions on First Run**: If it's the user's first time playing, an instruction pop-up will guide them on how to play.
- **Computer Selection**: The computer makes a random move each round.
- **Round Results**: The game displays the results of each round (win, lose, or tie), along with the updated scores for both the player and the computer.
- **Winner Announcement**: Once a player (human or computer) reaches 5 points, the game announces the winner.
- **Restart Option**: After the winner is displayed, the user can click "Play Again" to start a new game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be as responsive as possible for different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across various devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the game interface.
