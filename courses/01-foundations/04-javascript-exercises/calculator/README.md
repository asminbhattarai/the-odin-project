# Calculator Project

A simple web-based calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates basic front-end development skills and logic implementation.

## Features

- Performs basic mathematical operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.
- Handles floating-point numbers and rounding for long decimal results.
- Displays a user-friendly interface with a **number display**, operator buttons, and functional buttons.
- Handles multiple operator presses.
- Includes a snarky error message for invalid operations like division by zero.
- Allows users to input decimal points and prevents invalid inputs.
- Keyboard support for numbers, operators, and some functions.

## How It Works

1. Users input numbers and operators using the buttons or keyboard.
2. The calculator stores:
   - First number
   - Operator
   - Second number
3. When the `=` button is pressed, it computes the result using the stored values.
4. The `clear` button resets the calculator, and the `backspace` button deletes the last input.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the calculator layout.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the calculator visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the calculator's logic and interactivity.
