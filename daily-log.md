# Daily Log - 2024/11/27

## What I worked on:
- I installed linux and chrome as per directions given in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installations).
- Though VS Code is recommended (up until today), since my laptop was pretty old, I learnt basics of Vim instead.
- I followed through all seven lessons of [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

## Challenges faced:
- Shell scripting pipeline alongside loop proved tough for me.

## Resources:
- All links have been provided above already.

## Next steps:
- I plan to finish the lesson of command lines by tomorrow.

## Reflections:
- Shell scripting, though basic, is helpful a lot of times. I realized that a ton of my past problems could have been done easily by few lines of shell scripting.
- As suggested in The Odin Project, I should have just practiced first three chapters of The Unix Shell. All seven chapters took a lot of time.


# Daily Log - 2024/11/28

## What I worked on:
- I completed assignments of command line basics.
- I improved git commit message based on git lessons and commit messages lesson in HTML section.
- I created an HTML boilerplate and worked with text, list, links and images basics.
- I also completed my first HTML project: Recipes.

## Challenges faced:
- Setting Github live preview proved tough for me.

## Resources:
- I got free images from [unsplash](unsplash.com).

## Next steps:
- I plan to start learning CSS lessons starting from tomorrow.

## Reflections:
- I tried setting custom domain name and wasted a lot of time. I should maybe do it after I am a bit more proficient.
- I should add warp settings to daily log as well; maybe it will look a bit better.


# Daily Log - 2024/11/29

## What I worked on:
- I completed assignments of CSS Foundations.
- I learnt to inspect HTML and CSS in Google Chrome.
- I learnt CSS concepts (basic syntax, cascade, box model, display).
- I improvised HTML project: Recipes based on what I learnt today.

## Challenges faced:
- Assignment related to combined (CSS) specifity and order was confusing for me.

## Resources:
- I picked color from [color picker](htmlcolorcodes.com) for webpages.

## Next steps:
- I plan to learn CSS Flexbox lessons tommorow.
- I will add syntax highlighting to Vim for better efficiency.

## Reflections
- CSS: Order is not the only thing that affects styling priority of an element.


# Daily Log - 2024/11/30

## What I worked on:
- I completed assignments of Flexbox.
- I learnt about flex containers, items and axes.
- I learnt about three properties of shorthand 'flex'.
- I learnt how to position elements using flexbox.

## Challenges faced:
- Padding and margin proved confusing when mixed with flex property.

## Resources:
- I did not use any additional resources today, except the ones mentioned in The Odin Project.

## Next steps:
- I plan to do project 'Landing Page'.
- I will implement syntax highlighting to Vim.

## Reflections:
- Inspecting webpages can help a lot to solve difficult problems.
- Wrapping daily-log breaks links, so I need to find another method.
