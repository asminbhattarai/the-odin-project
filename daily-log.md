# Daily Log - 2024/11/27

## What I worked on:
- Installed Linux and Chrome following instructions from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installations).
- Since my laptop is quite old, I opted to learn the basics of Vim instead of using VS Code (recommended until today).
- Completed all seven lessons of [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

## Challenges faced:
- Understanding the shell scripting pipeline, especially when combining it with loops, was challenging.

## Resources:
- Referenced the links above.

## Next steps:
- Plan to complete the remaining lessons on command line basics by tomorrow.

## Reflections:
- Shell scripting, although basic, has been surprisingly helpful in solving problems more efficiently. I now realize that many of my past challenges could have been addressed with just a few lines of code.
- In hindsight, I should have stuck to the first three chapters of The Unix Shell, as suggested in The Odin Project. Completing all seven chapters took a lot of time.


# Daily Log - 2024/11/28

## What I worked on:
- Completed the assignments for command line basics.
- Improved my git commit messages based on lessons from the [Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics#git-best-practices) section and the [Commit Messages](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-commit-messages) lesson.
- Created an HTML boilerplate and practiced text, list, links, and images.
- Finished my first HTML project, 'Recipes', which involved creating a basic recipe website layout.

## Challenges faced:
- Setting up a live preview on Github was challenging.

## Resources:
- I sourced free images from [Unsplash](unsplash.com).

## Next steps:
- Plan to start learning CSS lessons tomorrow.

## Reflections:
- I spent a lot of time trying to set a custom domain name, but it didn’t work out as expected. I think it’s better to revisit this task once I’m more proficient.
- I should consider adding warp settings to the daily log for better formatting.


# Daily Log - 2024/11/29

## What I worked on:
- Completed the assignments for CSS Foundations.
- Learned how to inspect HTML and CSS in Google Chrome.
- Gained an understanding of basic CSS concepts such as syntax, cascade, box model, and display.
- Enhanced my HTML "Recipes" project with newly acquired CSS knowledge.

## Challenges faced:
- The assignment on CSS specificity and order was confusing.

## Resources:
- Used the color picker tool from [HTML Color Codes](htmlcolorcodes.com) to pick colors for the webpage.

## Next steps:
- Plan to start learning CSS Flexbox lessons tomorrow.
- Implement syntax highlighting in Vim for better efficiency.

## Reflections
- CSS: It's not just the order that affects the styling priority of an element. Specificity also plays a crucial role.


# Daily Log - 2024/11/30

## What I worked on:
- Completed the assignments for Flexbox.
- Learned about flex containers, items, and axes.
- Understood the shorthand 'flex' property and its three main values.
- Learned how to position elements using Flexbox.

## Challenges faced:
- It was tricky to work with padding and margin when mixed with the flex property.

## Resources:
- No additional resources were used today, except those mentioned in The Odin Project.

## Next steps:
- Plan to work on the "Landing Page" project.
- Will implement syntax highlighting in Vim.

## Reflections:
- Inspecting web pages can be a valuable tool for solving difficult problems.
- Wrapping the daily log breaks links, so I need to find another method to organize it better.


# Daily Log - 2024/12/01

## What I worked on:
- Completed a few animated assignments from the additional resources section on Flexbox.
- Finished my second HTML project: "Landing Page."
- Implemented syntax highlighting in Vim.

## Challenges faced:
- The header section of the project took a long time to complete.

## Resources:
- Did not use any additional resources today, except those mentioned in The Odin Project.


## Next steps:
- Plan to begin JavaScript lessons tomorrow.

## Reflections:
- Starting to build a webpage based on my own design feels easier than following a pre-existing template or design to the letter.


# Daily Log - 2024/12/02

## What I worked on:
- Learned to run JavaScript code using an HTML file and the browser console.
- Completed exercises involving variable declarations, number and string operations.
- Gained a deeper understanding of logical and mathematical operators in JavaScript.
- Explored JavaScript data types, conditionals, and nesting.
- Familiarized myself with developer tools, including breakpoints and media query simulation.

## Challenges faced:
- Understanding how to effectively use breakpoints in the developer tools was a bit tricky. It took time to fully grasp how to pause code execution and inspect variables.

## Resources:
- Worked through the JavaScript lessons on The Odin Project.

## Next steps:
- Plan to continue with JavaScript lessons, focusing on functions.

## Reflections:
- It’s exciting to see how I can already write basic JS code and interact with the browser’s console. I’m looking forward to building more interactive functionality as I progress through the lessons.


# Daily Log - 2024/12/03

## What I worked on:
- Learned function basics: function definition, invocation, return values, scope, function expressions, and arrow functions.
- Explored the call stack in JavaScript.
- Practiced problem-solving techniques: planning, pseudocode, and dividing problems into sub-problems.
- Solved the FizzBuzz problem.
- Studied JavaScript errors: ReferenceError, SyntaxError, and TypeError, and learned to resolve them by researching error messages.
- Worked on the MDN number guessing game assignment and solved errors using the [MDN error handling guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong).

## Challenges faced:
- Struggled with arrow functions and understanding TypeErrors.

## Resources:
- Worked through the JavaScript lessons on The Odin Project.

## Next steps:
- Plan to start the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" project, focusing on console-based implementation.

## Reflections:
- Function basics are starting to feel more intuitive, but debugging TypeErrors is still tricky. It’s crucial to understand scope and function execution flow for smoother coding.


# Daily Log - 2024/12/04

## What I worked on:
- Worked on the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" console project in JavaScript.
- Focused on problem-solving and followed the steps from the Problem Solving lesson: planning, pseudocoding, writing the code, and testing it.
- Learned about clean code practices, including how to distinguish between hard-to-read and easy-to-read code, and used programming principles to improve code readability.
- Installed nvm (Node Version Manager), and practiced running the Node console.
- Worked on using arrays, loops, and test-driven development (TDD) exercises.

## Challenges faced:
- Writing clean code was more difficult than expected, especially when it came to making the code easy to understand and maintain.
- Also faced some challenges when adding custom functionality to the project.

## Resources:
- Used resources provided by The Odin Project.
- Found a helpful StackOverflow link to detect Mac OS in JavaScript: [Detect Mac OS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10527983/best-way-to-detect-mac-os-x-or-windows-computers-with-javascript-or-jquery#:~:text=var%20isMac%20%3D%20navigator.platform.toUpperCase\(\).indexOf(%27MAC%27)%3E%3D0%3B).

## Next steps:
- Plan to work on DOM manipulation and events.
- Improve the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.

## Reflections:
- Writing clean code is definitely easier said than done. It takes a lot of practice and careful attention to detail.
- I’m looking forward to adding more functionality and improving my code further.
