# Daily Log - 2024/11/27

## What I worked on:
- I installed linux and chrome as per directions given in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installations).
- Though VS Code is recommended (up until today), since my laptop was pretty old, I learnt basics of Vim instead.
- I followed through all seven lessons of [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

## Challenges faced:
- Shell scripting pipeline alongside loop proved tough for me.

## Resources:
- All links have been provided above already.

## Next steps:
- I plan to finish the lesson of command lines by tomorrow.

## Reflections:
- Shell scripting, though basic, is helpful a lot of times. I realized that a ton of my past problems could have been done easily by few lines of shell scripting.
- As suggested in The Odin Project, I should have just practiced first three chapters of The Unix Shell. All seven chapters took a lot of time.

## What I worked on:
- I completed assignments of command line basics.
- I improved git commit message based on git lessons and commit messages lesson in HTML section.
- I created an HTML boilerplate and worked with text, list, links and images basics.
- I also completed my first HTML project: Recipes.

## Challenges faced:
- Setting Github live preview proved tough for me.

## Resources:
- I got free images from [unsplash](unsplash.com).

## Next steps:
- I plan to start learning CSS lessons starting from tomorrow.

## Reflections:
- I tried setting custom domain name and wasted a lot of time. I should maybe do it after I am a bit more proficient.
- I should add warp setting to daily log as well; maybe it will look a but better.
