# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## About
This is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript. The game allows the player to play against the computer. The game runs in the browser’s console, where the outputs are shown. Prompts are displayed where the player can input their choice. The computer randomly selects its own move.

## Goal
The main goal of this project is to implement a basic interactive game where the user chooses one of three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and plays against the computer. The game tracks the scores for both the human player and the computer over a series of rounds.

## Features
- User inputs their choice through the prompt.
- The computer randomly selects its choice using JavaScript.
- The game displays the outcome of each round and updates the score accordingly.
- After a predefined number of rounds, the game announces the overall winner.
- The game can be restarted based on the user’s choice.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript

## How to Play
1. Open the developer console in your browser (press `CTRL + SHIFT + J` on Windows or `CMD + OPTION + J` on macOS).
2. When you run the game, the prompt will ask you for your move: either "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
3. The computer will randomly choose its move, and the result of each round will be shown in the console.
4. After 5 rounds, the game will display who won and ask if you want to play again.
